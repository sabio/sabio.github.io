I am a software engineer with a postgraduate degree in Information Technology. I sometimes do stuff with Python (which its backward compatibility and performance suck, they say), Java (which it's about to die because it's old, slow and Oracle acquired it, they say), PL / SQL (ugly as hell) and Javascript (which is ugly because in reality it is not OOP and it's hard to tell the difference between null, NaN and undefined, besides ",

  "app.whoamipart4": "Let's get serious. I am a Java EE Developer with 10 years of experience who likes software development, but that doesn't mean I think Java is the best of the best. I consider other programming languages such as Python, Javascript and Ruby very interesting so every dev should give them a try. I graduated from the University of Guadalajara at both Bachelor and Master levels. I love riding my bike and going to the gym.",
